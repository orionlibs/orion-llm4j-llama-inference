the First Edition of TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols. This is sure to be the bible for TCP/IP developers and users. Within minutes of picking up the text, I encountered several scenarios that had tripped up both my colleagues and myself in the past. Stevens reveals many of the mysteries once held tightly by the ever-elusive networking gurus. Having been involved in the implementation of TCP/IP for some years now, I consider this by far the finest text to date.
